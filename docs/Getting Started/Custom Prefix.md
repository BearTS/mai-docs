Mai wants everyone to customize the bot to their own tastes, hence, Mai allows server administrator to add their own personal **prefix**.

<br /><br />

You can check the prefix as well as the custom prefix you set just by typing `prefix` wherever Mai is in, and she will reply what is her prefix and the prefix you set, if you have one.

<br /><br />

To set the prefix, just use the command `m!setprefix <desired prefix>`. Prefix cannot be more than 5 characters long.

<br /><br />

:::note About the default prefix
After you set your custom prefix, the default prefix will still be usable. There is no way to remove the default prefix at all. Mai's developer reserves the right to revert any prefixes that may violate Discord's Term of Service and/or Mai's Term of Service.
:::

<br /><br />

You can change the custom prefix anytime by using the same command again. Note that only users with '`ADMINISTRATOR`' permissions may use this command.
